    <h1>It's been 40 years, why reflect on the Commodore 64 now?</h1>
<h2>Geography</h2>

    <p>I feel like the history and memory of gaming at home is largely dominated by American reflections of playing <br>
        Japanese home consoles.</p>
    <p>As a result most of early gamings most famous composers are also Japanese:<br> 
        Koji Kondo, Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura and Yuzo Koshiro to name but a few.</p>

    <p>But the famous composers of C64 music are all much closer to home, largely being from Europe <br>
    and all fluent in English, which allows for a lot of firsthand consumption of written and spoken interviews<br>
    which I feel gives a much closer link to these icons of gaming history than something fan-translated from Japanese<br>
    by a third-party</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>

    <p>When I first revisted Commodore 64 music as an adult, it was with embarrased hands-wringing, thinking it was<br>
        "Good for the time" and "Not actually comparable to famous Arcade music of the day, like Street Fighter 2"</p>

    <p>But this was an inaccuracy on my part. The Commodore 64 launched in 1982, and Street Fighter 2 <br>
        (the most famous arcade game for people of my age-group) came out in 1991.</p>
        <p>That's nearly a full decade, or a console generation and a half! It was obviously never going to be fair to
        compare<br>
        things of clearly different eras, but since the C64 is older than I am, I had just assumed that everything
        that<br>
        existed when I was a child were contemporaries of each other. </p>

    <p> When comparing the C64 to arcade games of the early 80s, I was genuinely shocked to realise that while the<br>
        graphics were obviously inferior, since the arcade hardware was more powerful, the C64 music absolutely
        blows<br>
        the arcade music out of the water. How could this be possible?</p>

    <p>For an example lets listen to the original theme song to the arcade version of Commando, released by Capcom in
        1985</p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Commando (Arcade):</figcaption>
            <audio src="assets/media/Commando-(Arcade)-Main-Theme-Music.mp3" controls loop></audio>
        </figure>
        <p>Now lets listen to the music of the C64 port, released that same year</p>
        <figure>
            <figcaption>Commando (C64):</figcaption>
            <audio src="assets/media/C64-Commando-Audio.mp3" controls loop></audio>
        </figure>

        <p>Even though the hardware is considerably less powerful than an arcade machine, it sounds better. How is this
            possible?</p>
    
        <h2>Sound chips</h2>
        <p>Computer audio sound chips have a set number of audio channels available, or voices.<br>
            Similar to how a human voice cannot sing a melody and a harmony at the same time, computer<br>
            audio channels have a similar restriction.<br>
            The number of channels limits how many simultaneous noises a sound chip can produce.<br>
            Some computer audio chips took it a step further, and allowed each channel to only produce a single kind of
            noise.</p>
            <p>There are four kinds of soundwaves that could be produced by hardware of the day:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Square: High pitched beeps for melodies</li>
            <li>Triangle: Low pitched beeps for basslines</li>
            <li>Sawtooth: Pulsing beeps with a click to approximate drums</li>
            <li>Noise: Sound of audio static. Often used for lighter percussion instruments and ambient crowd noises.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Lets look at how one of the contemporaries of the day had it's sound channels set up.</h3>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Nintendo Entertainment System Sound Channels:</figcaption>
            <img src="assets/images/Sound_voices_NES.png">
        </figure>
    
        <p>As you can see the first two channels are solely dedicated to the square waves, the third to triangle,<br>
            and the fourth to noise. These channels could produce these and only these sounds. If a composer wished to<br>
            compose a song using 3 or 4 square wave sounds, this was not possible. Also note there is no channel for<br>
            sawtooth so the NES could not produce this sound at all. </p>
            <p>Though not strictly relevant to this topic, the fifth "PCM sample" channel on the NES was used for sampling,<br>
            or snippets of real world voices or music. But because this was incredibly storage space intensive on the
            small<br>
            size cartridges of the day, it was rarely used.</p>

            <h2>The C64's sound chip</h2>

    <p>Known as the Sound Interface Device, or SID, it allowed for what feels like considerably more complexity<br>
        and depth to the music all with a distinctive "synth" flavour.<br> 
        Even though it only had three sound channels.</p>

    <p>How did it do it?</p>

    <figure>
        <figcaption>C64 Sound Channels (all one soundwave):</figcaption>
        <img src="assets/images/Sounds_Voices_C64_Sawtooth.png">
    </figure>
    <p>As you can see, not only can the C64 SID chip do the sawtooth waveform which the NES cannot.</p>
    <figure>
        <figcaption>C64 Sound Channels (any combination):</figcaption>
        <img src="assets/images/Sounds_Voices_C64_Combination.png">
    </figure>
    <p>It also can freely reassign each channel to be each waveform as it so wishes.</p>

    <h2>See the SID in action</h2>


    <p>This music is visualised in an Oscilloscope so you can see each of the three different sound channels at work<p>

    <video src="assets/media/C64-Commando-Oscilloscope-3m-360p.mp4" controls></video>
    <p>See the different waveforms on the same channel?</p>
    <p>Try watching only one track at a time, and you'll see it jump back and forth between two different waveforms, like square and noise</p>
