    <h1>History is written by the winners
    </h1>
        <p>Most of gaming history from the early 1980s are all centralised to one country: Japan.<br>
            Mario, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaxian and Space Invaders were all developed there and exported to the rest
            of the world.</p>
    
        <p>Since the granddaddy of Japanese gaming, Nintendos first home console: The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES),<br> 
            was not widely released nor popular in Europe AND since the Commodore 64 itself wasn't popular in Japan; these <br> 
            two factors combined make it as if there are alternative unconnected reality that exists in gaming history.</p>
            <ul>
        <li>The US and Japan had their 8-bit home gaming consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega
            Mastersystem</li>
        <li>Europe favoured their 8-bit microcomputers: The ZX Spectrum, The Amiga, The Amstrad and the Legendary Commodore 64</li>
    </ul>
            <p>These realities would all get consolidated together in the early 1990s when the Super Nintendo and the Sega Megadrive would rise<br> 
            to global domination.</p>
    
        <p>The Commodore 64 sadly wouldn't survive this fight, it's parent company went bankrupt and it slowly faded from memory.</p>
    
        <p>But before all that......</p>
        
        <h1>There were good times</h1>
    
        <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>
    
        <p>The Commodore 64 has the distinction of the "highest selling single computer model"<br> 
        with sales estimated to be between 12 and 17 million</p>
    
    
        <p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers<br>
            of the time, and cartridge home consoles like the Atari 2600</p>
    
        <p>One of its main selling points, and part of it's namesake was the 64 Kilobytes of RAM it contained.<br>
            This was incredibly powerful compared to it's contemporaries of the day, but considering that a modern<br>
            phone, the iPhone Pro 13 has 6 million kilobytes of RAM, even something that was lauded in it's day is<br>
            94 thousand times LESS powerful than devices we now carry around in our pockets.
        </p>
    
        <p> Another of its primary points of appeal was its price. It retailed in America at $595, which might seem like<br>
            a lot, but one of its closest competitors was the original IBM PC, which retailed at $1,565! The IBM PC it<br>
            should also be noted only had 16KB of RAM!</p>
    
        <p> Doing a conversion to euro for those prices feels little inaccurate, since we're discussing events from so<br>
            long ago, the euro currency did not exist at the time, but assuming it did with the same exchange rate as<br>
            2022, it would be €560 for the Commodore and €1491 for the IBM PC.</p>
    
        <p> If you think those prices are ridiculous, with inflation taken into account, in modern money the Commodore<br>
            would retail for $1840/€1730 and the IBM PC for $4830/€4544</p>
    
        <p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic cassette tape, as well as write code<br> 
            and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>
