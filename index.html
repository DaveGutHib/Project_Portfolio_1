    <h1>History is written by the winners
    </h1>
    <p>Most of gaming history from the early 1980s are all centralised to one country: Japan.<br>
        Mario, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaxian and Space Invaders were all developed there and exported to the rest
        of the world.</p>

    <p>Since the granddaddy of Japanese gaming, Nintendos first home console: The Nintendo Entertainment System
        (NES),<br>
        was not widely released nor popular in Europe AND since the Commodore 64 itself wasn't popular in Japan; these
        <br>
        two factors combined make it as if there are alternative unconnected reality that exists in gaming history.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The US and Japan had their 8-bit home gaming consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega
            Mastersystem</li>
        <li>Europe favoured their 8-bit microcomputers: The ZX Spectrum, The Amiga, The Amstrad and the Legendary
            Commodore 64</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These realities would all get consolidated together in the early 1990s when the Super Nintendo and the Sega
        Megadrive would rise<br>
        to global domination.</p>

    <p>The Commodore 64 sadly wouldn't survive this fight, it's parent company went bankrupt and it slowly faded from
        memory.</p>

    <p>But before all that......</p>

    <h1>There were good times</h1>

    <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>

    <p>The Commodore 64 has the distinction of the "highest selling single computer model"<br>
        with sales estimated to be between 12 and 17 million</p>


    <p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers<br>
        of the time, and cartridge home consoles like the Atari 2600</p>

    <p>One of its main selling points, and part of it's namesake was the 64 Kilobytes of RAM it contained.<br>
        This was incredibly powerful compared to it's contemporaries of the day, but considering that a modern<br>
        phone, the iPhone Pro 13 has 6 million kilobytes of RAM, even something that was lauded in it's day is<br>
        94 thousand times LESS powerful than devices we now carry around in our pockets.
    </p>

    <p> Another of its primary points of appeal was its price. It retailed in America at $595, which might seem like<br>
        a lot, but one of its closest competitors was the original IBM PC, which retailed at $1,565! The IBM PC it<br>
        should also be noted only had 16KB of RAM!</p>

    <p> Doing a conversion to euro for those prices feels little inaccurate, since we're discussing events from so<br>
        long ago, the euro currency did not exist at the time, but assuming it did with the same exchange rate as<br>
        2022, it would be €560 for the Commodore and €1491 for the IBM PC.</p>

    <p> If you think those prices are ridiculous, with inflation taken into account, in modern money the Commodore<br>
        would retail for $1840/€1730 and the IBM PC for $4830/€4544</p>

    <p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic cassette tape, as well as write code<br>
        and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>

    <h3>Fun fact:</h3>
    <p>All copies of The Great Giana Sisters were removed from sale and never saw a rerelease.
        It is believed this was to placate Nintendo, who attempted to take the creators to court!
